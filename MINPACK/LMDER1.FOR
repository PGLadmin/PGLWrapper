C
C     SUBROUTINE LMDER1
C
C     THE PURPOSE OF LMDER1 IS TO MINIMIZE THE SUM OF THE SQUARES OF
C     M NONLINEAR FUNCTIONS IN N VARIABLES BY A MODIFICATION OF THE
C     LEVENBERG-MARQUARDT ALGORITHM. THIS IS DONE BY USING THE MORE
C     GENERAL LEAST-SQUARES SOLVER LMDER. THE USER MUST PROVIDE A
C     SUBROUTINE WHICH CALCULATES THE FUNCTIONS AND THE JACOBIAN.
C
C     THE SUBROUTINE STATEMENT IS
C
C       SUBROUTINE LMDER1(FCN,M,N,X,FVEC,FJAC,LDFJAC,TOL,INFO,
C                         IPVT,WA,LWA)
C
C     WHERE
C
C       FCN IS THE NAME OF THE USER-SUPPLIED SUBROUTINE WHICH
C         CALCULATES THE FUNCTIONS AND THE JACOBIAN. FCN MUST
C         BE DECLARED IN AN EXTERNAL STATEMENT IN THE USER
C         CALLING PROGRAM, AND SHOULD BE WRITTEN AS FOLLOWS.
C
C         SUBROUTINE FCN(M,N,X,FVEC,FJAC,LDFJAC,IFLAG)
C         INTEGER M,N,LDFJAC,IFLAG
C         DOUBLE PRECISION X(N),FVEC(M),FJAC(LDFJAC,N)
C         ----------
C         IF IFLAG = 1 CALCULATE THE FUNCTIONS AT X AND
C         RETURN THIS VECTOR IN FVEC. DO NOT ALTER FJAC.
C         IF IFLAG = 2 CALCULATE THE JACOBIAN AT X AND
C         RETURN THIS MATRIX IN FJAC. DO NOT ALTER FVEC.
C         ----------
C         RETURN
C         END
C
C         THE VALUE OF IFLAG SHOULD NOT BE CHANGED BY FCN UNLESS
C         THE USER WANTS TO TERMINATE EXECUTION OF LMDER1.
C         IN THIS CASE SET IFLAG TO A NEGATIVE INTEGER.
C
C       M IS A POSITIVE INTEGER INPUT VARIABLE SET TO THE NUMBER
C         OF FUNCTIONS.
C
C       N IS A POSITIVE INTEGER INPUT VARIABLE SET TO THE NUMBER
C         OF VARIABLES. N MUST NOT EXCEED M.
C
C       X IS AN ARRAY OF LENGTH N. ON INPUT X MUST CONTAIN
C         AN INITIAL ESTIMATE OF THE SOLUTION VECTOR. ON OUTPUT X
C         CONTAINS THE FINAL ESTIMATE OF THE SOLUTION VECTOR.
C
C       FVEC IS AN OUTPUT ARRAY OF LENGTH M WHICH CONTAINS
C         THE FUNCTIONS EVALUATED AT THE OUTPUT X.
C
C       FJAC IS AN OUTPUT M BY N ARRAY. THE UPPER N BY N SUBMATRIX
C         OF FJAC CONTAINS AN UPPER TRIANGULAR MATRIX R WITH
C         DIAGONAL ELEMENTS OF NONINCREASING MAGNITUDE SUCH THAT
C
C                T     T           T
C               P *(JAC *JAC)*P = R *R,
C
C         WHERE P IS A PERMUTATION MATRIX AND JAC IS THE FINAL
C         CALCULATED JACOBIAN. COLUMN J OF P IS COLUMN IPVT(J)
C         (SEE BELOW) OF THE IDENTITY MATRIX. THE LOWER TRAPEZOIDAL
C         PART OF FJAC CONTAINS INFORMATION GENERATED DURING
C         THE COMPUTATION OF R.
C
C       LDFJAC IS A POSITIVE INTEGER INPUT VARIABLE NOT LESS THAN M
C         WHICH SPECIFIES THE LEADING DIMENSION OF THE ARRAY FJAC.
C
C       TOL IS A NONNEGATIVE INPUT VARIABLE. TERMINATION OCCURS
C         WHEN THE ALGORITHM ESTIMATES EITHER THAT THE RELATIVE
C         ERROR IN THE SUM OF SQUARES IS AT MOST TOL OR THAT
C         THE RELATIVE ERROR BETWEEN X AND THE SOLUTION IS AT
C         MOST TOL.
C
C       INFO IS AN INTEGER OUTPUT VARIABLE. IF THE USER HAS
C         TERMINATED EXECUTION, INFO IS SET TO THE (NEGATIVE)
C         VALUE OF IFLAG. SEE DESCRIPTION OF FCN. OTHERWISE,
C         INFO IS SET AS FOLLOWS.
C
C         INFO = 0  IMPROPER INPUT PARAMETERS.
C
C         INFO = 1  ALGORITHM ESTIMATES THAT THE RELATIVE ERROR
C                   IN THE SUM OF SQUARES IS AT MOST TOL.
C
C         INFO = 2  ALGORITHM ESTIMATES THAT THE RELATIVE ERROR
C                   BETWEEN X AND THE SOLUTION IS AT MOST TOL.
C
C         INFO = 3  CONDITIONS FOR INFO = 1 AND INFO = 2 BOTH HOLD.
C
C         INFO = 4  FVEC IS ORTHOGONAL TO THE COLUMNS OF THE
C                   JACOBIAN TO MACHINE PRECISION.
C
C         INFO = 5  NUMBER OF CALLS TO FCN WITH IFLAG = 1 HAS
C                   REACHED 100*(N+1).
C
C         INFO = 6  TOL IS TOO SMALL. NO FURTHER REDUCTION IN
C                   THE SUM OF SQUARES IS POSSIBLE.
C
C         INFO = 7  TOL IS TOO SMALL. NO FURTHER IMPROVEMENT IN
C                   THE APPROXIMATE SOLUTION X IS POSSIBLE.
C
C       IPVT IS AN INTEGER OUTPUT ARRAY OF LENGTH N. IPVT
C         DEFINES A PERMUTATION MATRIX P SUCH THAT JAC*P = Q*R,
C         WHERE JAC IS THE FINAL CALCULATED JACOBIAN, Q IS
C         ORTHOGONAL (NOT STORED), AND R IS UPPER TRIANGULAR
C         WITH DIAGONAL ELEMENTS OF NONINCREASING MAGNITUDE.
C         COLUMN J OF P IS COLUMN IPVT(J) OF THE IDENTITY MATRIX.
C
C       WA IS A WORK ARRAY OF LENGTH LWA.
C
C       LWA IS A POSITIVE INTEGER INPUT VARIABLE NOT LESS THAN 5*N+M.
