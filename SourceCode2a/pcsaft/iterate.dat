 RUNNING THE L-BFGS-B CODE

 it    = iteration number
 nf    = number of function evaluations
 nint  = number of segments explored during the Cauchy search
 nact  = number of active bounds at the generalized Cauchy point
 sub   = manner in which the subspace minimization terminated:
         con = converged, bnd = a bound was reached
 itls  = number of iterations performed in the line search
 stepl = step length used
 tstep = norm of the displacement (total step)
 projg = norm of the projected gradient
 f     = function value
