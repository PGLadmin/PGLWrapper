After a "near-death" experience, I decided to include these files in the repository. 
A seven-year old laptop is not a reliable place to store the code that tests how all the other codes work together.
These codes are even more of an embarrassment than SourceCodeUA. They are sometimes redundant and full of spaghetti. 
I always dreamed of upgrading FlashSubs to implement the methodologies of Michelsen & Mollerup, but never did.
My best suggestion is that you ignore these codes entirely. Nevertheless, you can construct a working project by inserting: 
Main&Menu, FlashSubs, MinPack, SourceCodeUa, SourceCode2a. It may be helpful to start with a (crudely) working
project, then systematically upgrade the components that are most egregious. 
Good luck!
